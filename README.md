# MFDFA
Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis `MFDFA` is a model-independent method to uncover the self-similarity of a stochastic process or auto-regressive model.
`DFA` was first developed by Peng *et al*<sup>1</sup> and later extended to study multifractality `MFDFA` by Kandelhardt *et al*<sup>2</sup>.

# The `MFDFA` library
The `MFDFA` library is a standalone `numpy`-dependent only library to study self-similarity and factality in stochastic processes.

# Employing the `MFDFA` library
To study the self-similarity of a stochastic process...
