# MFDFA
Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis `MFDFA` is a model-independent method to uncover the self-similarity of a stochastic process or auto-regressive model.
`DFA` was first developed by Peng *et al*<sup>1</sup> and later extended to study multifractality `MFDFA` by Kandelhardt *et al*<sup>2</sup>.

# The `MFDFA` library
The `MFDFA` library is a standalone `numpy`-dependent only library to study self-similarity and factality in stochastic processes.

# Employing the `MFDFA` library
To study the self-similarity of a stochastic process...

# Literature and Support
### History
This project was started in 2019 at the [Department of Mathematics, University of Oslo](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/research/groups/risk-stochastics/) in the Risk and Stochastics section by Leonardo Rydin Gorjão and is supported by Dirk Witthaut and the [Institute of Energy and Climate Research Systems Analysis and Technology Evaluation](https://www.fz-juelich.de/iek/iek-ste/EN/Home/home_node.html).

### Funding
Helmholtz Association Initiative _Energy System 2050 - A Contribution of the Research Field Energy_ and the grant No. VH-NG-1025 and *STORM - Stochastics for Time-Space Risk Models* project of the Research Council of Norway (RCN) No. 274410.
